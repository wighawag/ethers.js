Generally this issue template should be used.

If your issue is **not** a **Feature Request**, a **Bug Report** or problem with the **Documentation** you should probably be using the *"Discussion"* tab at the top.

But for truly exceptional issues, please include the details here.

Please also include any search terms you used when searching issues and discussions, so we can better tag those in the future.
